## Testplan and output





 Propulsion Power
For an initial speed of 10km/h
Vi=10km/h=2.78m/s




 Dynamic mode
Traction force
Acceleration of the vehicle for t=60sec is given by


a=0.139m/s^2
Wind speed is from 10km/h to 19km/h
Average wind speed,Vw=15km/h=4.17m/s
Vf=40km/h=11.12m/s
Relative speed of vehicle with respect to that of wind is
Vr=4.17+11.12=15.29m/s
Calculation of dynamic force

Fd=1.286kN








 Propulsion Power
For a velocity of 40km/h
Vf=40km/h=11.12m/s
Calculation of dynamic power





Discharge Current
 Initial mode
Consider the motor rating voltage to be 230V

Calculation of initial current,Ii=54.40A
 Dynamic mode---
 Calculation of dynamic current ,Id=62.17A
 Motor rating--16.3kW
Battery Capacity-------
Battery capacity in kWh 16.3kWh
Battery capacity in Ah  70.86 Ah


State of charge
Case: 1
                  initial = 15 mins
                 dynamic = 15 mins
SOC(t) =100 + 
              100 +
SOC(t) = 58.87%

Case: 2
                  initial = 20 mins	
                 dynamic = 10 mins
 SOC(t) =100 + 
              100 +
 SOC(t) = 60.11%
 
 Case: 3
                  initial = 10 mins
                 dynamic = 20 mins
 SOC(t) = 100 +
               =100+*100
               =100+*100
               =100-40.217
SOC(t) = 59.783%
