# Description
An appliction that provides the information regarding terminal voltage ,battery capacity and State of charge taking various parameters into considerationters into cons






# Requirements


## High level Requirements
*  To find battery capacity and thereby design battery accordingly.
*  To find State of charge of the battery using coulomb counting method.




## Low level requirements
*  Taking certain parametrs into consideration traction force is calculated in both initial and dynamic mode.
*  Using traction force propulsion power is calculated.
*  Using propulsion power battery capacity is determined.
*   State of charge is calciulated using coulomb counting method taking initial SOC into account.


## SWOT Analysis
* Strength -  1] Automated calculation of battery capacity
              2] Easier approach to design series and parallel combination of the batteries. 

* Weakness -  1] Numerous parameters to be considered since the formulas are complicated
              2] Parameters like wind speed may vary form place to place.

 * Oppurtunities - 1]Can be used to find the exact motor rating that is required for the vehicle
                   2]Easier approach to implement battery pack designing in EVs.

  * Threats -    1] Fully charged battery is assumed in SOC determination that may not be the case             everytime   



##5W's and 1H
* What -To determine the terminal battery voltage and thereby estimate state of charge

* Why-Designing battery pack requires tjhe amount of terminal voltage required.

* When-During the designing of battery pack.

* Where-In industries that manufacture EV's.

* Who-Engineers involved in application of battery  managemenet systems in electric vehicles.

* How-Taking nominal parameters into consideration and coding according to the flowchart that is proposed.
